Boston Beers

//Description

This app provides a wide variety of beers from all over New England. It provides information about each particular beer and the brewery it comes from.

The purpose is to let users explore their options and rate which beers they enjoy to allow them to keep track so they can explore the breweries in person.

The welcome page is where users can register or sign in if already registered. When the register href is clicked the user will be redirected to the register page. If the user clicks the sign in page they will be redirected to the sign in page.

Once registered and signed in the user will be redirected to the index page where all the beers will be displayed. On the index page there are routes to the show, new, and edit pages.

If the user clicks on one of the buttons associated with the route they will be redirected to said route. There is also a delete button which will delete the beer from the page if clicked.

The show page also has a delete button and edit route.

If the add new beer route at the bottom of the index page is clicked the user will be redirected to the new page where they will be able to add a new beer and all its information, which will be pushed and displayed to the index page.


// Future goals
To implement a feature that gives users their own profile to keep track of the beers they have rated.

To keep track of the rating system so each beer will have an average number of stars based on the stats from user ratings.
Prevent users from being able to delete beers they did not personally add, AND to prevent others (exception of admin) from editing beers that they didn't personally add to the app.
